     * Calculates whether a shape collides/overlaps with another shape using their support function only. <p>
     * The support function of a shape calculates the furthest point in a set direction.<p>
     * <p>
     * By GJKSM it is required, that both given shapes are convex shapes.
     * If you wanna test concave shapes, you will have to split them into convex shapes first. <p>
     * <p>
     * This method is based on the GJKSM invariant named by and after
     * GJK the basic underlying principle
     * Stelly a gamedev working at valve (at least at the time)
     * and Muratori reducing its compexity down to testing instead of heavy math.
     * <p>
     * This algorithm below is adjusted to 2d space instead of 3d space and therefore some checks arent necessary,
     * since an unfinished triangle (3 points, 2 vectors) already determines collision.
     * <p>
     * This algorithm was implemented and alternated on 19th of June by Julius K.
